## Introduction

The course will provide an overview of fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning. Mathematical and coding exercises will be provided to deepen understanding of these concepts and algorithms. The topics include: 

 - Regression/Classification Basics: Linear regression, logistic regression, probability interpretations, generalized linear models, etc.
 - Optimization: convexity, (stochastic) gradient descent, momentum method, line search, second-order methods, gradient-free optimizations, etc.
 - Neural Networks: classic neural network architectures and training techniques using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

### Course format

We will interleave lecture and coding. We will use Google colab as the platform to do exercises. 
                
## Instructors

- Lab organizer: Dr. Yangchen Pan (Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com)
- TAs: Dr. Jindong Gu, Dr. Alasdair Paren

## Course Policy

### Grading

Naming rules: for example, for exercise1, you should have: firstname-lastname-ex1.ipynb, firstname-lastname-ex1-bonus.ipynb (if available)

Put firstname-lastname-ex1.ipynb, firstname-lastname-ex2.ipynb, ... files into a zip file named as firstname-lastname.zip, and leave the bonus files separate without zip them. 

That is, in the end of the course, you should submit firstname-lastname.zip and firstname-lastname-ex1-bonus.ipynb, firstname-lastname-ex2-bonus.ipynb, etc. 

### Attendance

At the end of each day, before leaving, please ask the instructor or TAs to review your completed exercises. After that, please sign the attendance sheet.

### Assignments should be completed individually, however, discussion is encouraged.

### Break

1. Lunch break: 11:50 am - 1:20 pm

2. Weds afternoon

## Syllabus

We will go through the following content in 5 days. We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises.

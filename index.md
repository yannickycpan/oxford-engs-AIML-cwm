## Grading Policy

Save all your work in a single Colab notebook for each day.

The notebooks for each day should be stored in a single folder which will be sent to the instructor as a zip folder at the of the course.

On each day, before you leave, ask one of us to take a look at your exercise, and then sign a sheet. This would be used as the attendance for that day.

Assignments should be completed individually, however, discussion is encouraged.

## Introduction

The course is about AI/ML with python. The course will provide a quick introduction to Python and the theoretical foundations 
of basic concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We will look into the following topics in detail: 

 - Regression/classification basics
 - Optimization
 - Neural Networks
                
## Instructors

- Lab organizer: Dr. Yangchen Pan (Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com)
- TAs: Dr. Jindong Gu, Dr. Alasdair Paren

## Course Policy

### Grading

Save all your work in a single Colab notebook for each day.

The notebooks for each day should be stored in a single folder which will be sent to the instructor as a zip folder at the of the course.

On each day, before you leave, ask one of us to take a look at your exercise, and then give signiture. This would be used as the attendance for that day.

Assignments should be completed individually, however, discussion is encouraged.

### Break

1. Lunch break: 11:50 am - 1:30 pm

2. Weds afternoon

## Syllabus

We will go through the following content in 5 days.

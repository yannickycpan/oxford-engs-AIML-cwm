## Introduction

The course is about AI/ML with python. The course will provide a quick introduction to Python and the theoretical foundations 
of basic concepts in machine learning and artificial intelligence. We will look into the following topics in detail: 

 - Regression/classification
 - Optimization
 - Neural Networks

The course content is adapted from Naeemullah Khan's course [website](https://naeemullah-khan.github.io/CWM2022/). 
                
## Instructors

- Lab organizer: Dr. Yangchen Pan (Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com)
- TAs: Dr. Jindong Gu, Dr. Alasdair Paren

## Grading Policy

Save all your work in a single Colab notebook for each day.

The notebooks for each day should be stored in a single folder which will be sent to the instructor as a zip folder at the of the course.

On each day, before you leave, ask one of us to take a look at your exercise, and then sign a sheet. This would be used as the attendance for that day.

Assignments should be completed individually, however, discussion is encouraged.

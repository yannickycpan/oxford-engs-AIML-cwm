## Introduction

The course will provide an overview of fundamental concepts and algorithms in machine learning. Mathematical and coding exercises will be provided to deepen understanding of these concepts and algorithms. The topics include: 

 - Regression/Classification Basics: Linear regression, logistic regression, probability interpretations, generalized linear models, etc.
 - Optimization: convexity, (stochastic) gradient descent, momentum method, line search, second-order methods, gradient-free optimizations, etc.
 - Neural Networks: classic neural network architectures and training techniques using PyTorch and TensorFlow.

### Learning outcomes

The learning outcomes of my CWM AI/ML with python are:

- Learn the fundamental concepts of machine learning
- Gain hands-on experience implementing machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems
- Achieve a certain level of theoretical familiarity with machine learning algorithms to prepare for the next stage of study
- Improve logic/mathematical thinking capabilities

### Prerequisite

There are only optional prerequisites, not mandatory ones, as the course is intended to be self-contained. Relevant programming and math backgrounds will be reviewed on the first day of the course.

- A certain level of familiarity with Python is recommended but not mandatory, as it can typically be learned while working on the exercises.
- Some math background is helpful: basic concepts in linear algebra, probability, and statistics, such as singular value decomposition, basis, and parameter estimation.

### Course format

We will interleave lecture and coding. We will use Google colab as the platform to do exercises.

### Grading

Naming rules: for example, for exercise1, you may have: firstname-lastname-ex1.ipynb

**Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com**. Please make sure the files are named correctly as specified above. 

Choose three exercise files in total to submit, at least one of them should be from optimization part. 

**Email subject line**: Firstname-Lastname-CWMweek7

Please include the **links** to access your file in your email, so make sure your file is authorized to view for anyone with the link. 

### Attendance

At the end of each day, before leaving, please ask the instructor or TAs to review your completed exercises. After that, please sign the attendance sheet.

**Assignments should be completed individually, however, discussion is encouraged.**

### Break

1. Lunch break: 11:50 am - 1:20 pm

2. Weds afternoon

## Syllabus

We will go through the following content in 5 days. We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises. 

**NOTE 1: for each colab file below, you should make a copy in your own google drive to edit & run.**

**NOTE 2: some questions are "optional"---you are suggested but not required to do.**

**NOTE 3: please do not work on the exercises below before your registered session officially starts, as there might be significant updates.**
